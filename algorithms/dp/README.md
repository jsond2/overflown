# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map,etc).

### Steps to Solve a DP Problem

1. Visualize Examples
2. Find appropriate sub-problem
3. Finding relationships among sub-problems
4. Generalize the relationship
5. Implement by solving sub-problems in order
