## A place for overflowed thoughts and ideas

This is a place for overflowed thoughts and ideas. It is a place for me (and pontentially others) to write down my thoughts and ideas, and to share them with the world. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them. I've always felt overwhelmed by the amount of things I want to learn and do, and I hope this will help me organize my thoughts and ideas and act as a brain dump for myself.
