# Beauty of Two

$ Lemma:$ The number $2$ is the only even prime number.

$ Proof: $ Suppose by way of contradiction that there exists an even prime number $p$ other than $2$. Then $p$ is an even number, and $p > 2$. Since $p$ is prime, it cannot be divisible by any number less than $p$. Therefore, $p$ cannot be divisible by any even number less than $p$. But $p$ is even, so $p$ is divisible by $2$. This is a contradiction, so there is no even prime number other than $2$. $\square$
