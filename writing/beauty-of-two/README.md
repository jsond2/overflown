# Beauty of Two

The structure of this writing will be written as a proof for my claim for why the number $2$ is the most beautiful number, but this is not a formal proof. I am simiply writing this in a proof like structure as a fitting way to express my opinion.

$ Corollary: $ I've worn the number $2$ on my jersey for Lacrosse since I was freshman year of high school.

$ Proof: $  [My Hudl Account from HS](https://www.hudl.com/profile/8521344/Jason-Devers) $\square$

$ Lemma:$ The number $2$ is the only even prime number.

$ Proof: $ Suppose by way of contradiction that there exists an even prime number $p$ other than $2$. Then $p$ is an even number, and $p > 2$. Since $p$ is prime, it cannot be divisible by any number less than $p$. Therefore, $p$ cannot be divisible by any even number less than $p$. But $p$ is even, so $p$ is divisible by $2$. This is a contradiction, so there is no even prime number other than $2$. $\square$

$ Lemma: $ The number $2$ is what allows us to define the concept of parity.

$ Proof: $ Consider the definition of oddness: a number, $x$ is odd if $ \exists $ a number, $y$, such that $x = 2y + 1$. Similarly, consider the definition of evenness: a number, $x$ is even if $ \exists $ a number, $y$, such that $x = 2y$. This definition of oddness and evenness is only possible because of the existence of the number $2$. $\square$

$ Corollary: $ Binary is what allows us to communicate with computers.

$ Proof: $ Computers are built to understand binary. $\square$

$ Theorem: $ The number $2$ is the most beautiful number.

$ Proof: $
